# Research

My PhD research was on conformally invariant two-dimensional statistical physics models and their [continuum scaling limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schramm–Loewner_evolution). My papers address problems related to [percolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory), [conformal loop ensembles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_loop_ensemble), and the [Gaussian free field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_free_field). 

If you're interested in learning about this field of research and you aren't a mathematician, please read this [non-technical overview](pdf/sle-intro.pdf) of the key idea which drives much of the current research in conformally invariant probability. It discusses why this idea is so compelling and how it has been mathematically fruitful (accounting for two recent [Fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelin_Werner) [medals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Smirnov)).
