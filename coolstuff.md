# Cool Stuff

- Data Science
    - Software
        - Languages
            - **Python**. Most popular language for data science in industry. Also well-suited to application building.
            - **R**. Most popular language among statisticians. Excellent focus on user experience, and lots of amazing tooling.
            - **Julia**. A beautifully designed, fast, and increasingly popular language for data science and other scientific computing applications. My personal favorite.
        - Packages
            - **Plotly**. Beautiful, easy-to-make graphs for the web (both 2D and 3D). Very well integrated with Python, R, and Julia.
            - **Tidyverse**. An opinionated but powerful collection of packages for doing data science in R.
            - **Esquisse**. An R package for creating data visualizations quickly and beautifully, without code.
            - **Spark**. Distributed computing framework, commonly used in industry.
        - Applications
            - **Jupyter**. Very popular notebook computing environment which supports many languages, including Julia, Python, and R. 
            - **Pluto**. Julia-specific alternative to Jupyter which is *reactive* (changing anything causes everything downstream of it to change too).
            - **ObservableHQ**. Reactive notebooks specifically for Javascript.
            - **RStudio**. Premier development environment for R. Can also be used for both Python and Julia.
            - **Superset**. Open source data visualization dashboards. 
        - Miscellaneous
            - **RAWGraphs** ([rawgraphs.io](https://rawgraphs.io)) Kind of like Esquisse (or Superset), but it works as a web app that you can paste your data into as a CSV. Gives you a ton of cool visualizations and ways to map the data.
    - Websites
        - Applications
            - **CoCalc**. Cloud environment with excellent collaboration tools which supports practically every piece of open source scientific computing software.
            - **Colab**. A Google-managed cloud Jupyter environment; Python-only and with slightly hackish support for collaboration, but it *does* include free GPU, which is important for deep learning and some other applications.
            - **NextJournal**. Another free-GPU cloud Jupyter service.
        - Books
            - **Introduction to Data Science in R**. Superb online book written by Rafael Irizarry at Harvard.
        - Community
            - **Kaggle**. Datasets, problems, and contests.
        - Visualizations
            - [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu). Introduction to probability and statistics with some great visualizations. Based on D3.
            - [Permutation Test](https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/). Very nice scrollytelling exposition.
- Content creation tools and utilities
    - **Prismia**. Create and deploy interactive lessons.
    - **Desmos**. A mathlet creation environment for everyone.
    - **math3d.org**. Desmos, but in 3D. Really beautiful.
    - **JSXGraph**. Create reactive mathlets (with code). What Prismia uses for its 2D mathlet system.
    - **Ipe**. Desktop application for making precise 2D mathematical figures quickly (using a graphical user interface).
    - **TinyTeX**. An easy-to-use distribution of LaTeX that does not take up a ton of hard drive space.
    - **MathPix**. Snapshot math expressions or tables on your screen and convert them automatically to LaTeX (using optical character recognition).
    - **TextSniper**. Like MathPix, but with plain text. For macOS.
    - **Keyboard Maestro**. Automate tasks at the operating system level (e.g., scroll down 60 pixels and click, then repeat 100 times). Hopefully you don't need it often, but it's a lifesaver when you do.
    - **Copier**. Templating system for quickly creating new files or projects on your computer (a Python package). Especially useful for software projects with boilerplate, stock letters, etc.
    - **ungit**. A visual approach to version control. Solves a lot of Git's UX problems.
- Web development
    - **React**. One of the most popular Javascript frameworks for creating web applications.
    - **Svelte**. A front-end framework that's simple, really fast, and genuinely reactive.
    - **Visual Studio Code**. The development environment that all the cool kids are using these days.
    - **Firebase**. An easy way to create a low-cost, scalable web application. Hosting, database, and cloud functions are all integrated and well documented.
    - **AG Grid**. Possibly the best open source data table package for the web. Highly recommended over plain HTML for large tables.
- Learning
    - Websites
        - **Art of Problem Solving**. Premier math learning community for middle school and high school.
        - **Mathigon**. Most polished, beautiful math lessons on the internet.
        - **Data Gymnasia**. Data science content built on Mathigon technology.
        - **3Blue1Brown**. The best math videos on YouTube. Beautiful visualizations, original exposition, and excellent storytelling. 
        - **Distill.pub**. Visually stunning interactive articles on data science topics.
    - Books
        - **Concrete Mathematics** by Knuth, Graham, and Patashnik. Original, expertly crafted book on a variety of discrete math topics.
        - **Probability with Martingales** by David Williams. Succinct probability textbook from the University of Cambridge (the one I learned basic probability from).
        - **Linear Algebra Done Right** by Sheldon Axler. An expository masterpiece with an original and elegant take on basic linear algebra.
        - **Visual Complex Analysis** by Tristan Needham. The title says it all.
