# Learning Resources for Math 0350

## Final Exam Preparation

*   WeBWork final practice (available on WW or through Canvas)
*   [Practice final](../pdf/math0350_practicefinal.pdf)
*   [The final exam](http://legacy-www.math.harvard.edu/archive/) for Oliver Knill's course at Harvard (solutions included, also 15 excellent practice finals with solutions(!)). Skip anything about differential equations
*   [Concepts list](../pdf/math0350_concepts_list.pdf)

## General Resources

*   **Class time**. Come to class prepared to engage and ask questions. You will retain the material much better if it isn't totally unfamiliar the first time you see it in class.
*   **Book**. The book is concise and will get you directly to the main ideas
*   **Other Books**. [These notes](../pdf/Frederick.pdf) and [this online book](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/multivariable/)

*   **3Blue1Brown videos**. 3Blue1Brown is the YouTube moniker of a person who has made some conceptually lucid and graphically stunning explanatory math videos, including a whole [series on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). These videos are quite short and will provide you with some really valuable geometric intuition. These mental models are much more readily conveyed with the kinds of rich animation tools 3b1b is using. Highly recommended for the covered topics (mostly linear algebra, as well as a neural networks video)
*   **Cheat sheet**. A list of each week's learning objectives, including a quick recap of the most important concepts, is available [here](../pdf/math0350_concepts_list.pdf). This document is helpful for refreshing your memory on the most important concepts before you tackle the homework, and it's also helpful for identifying examinable content.
*   **Homework**. Complete each homework question with the goal of understanding it thoroughly. Reflect on the principles you used to solve the question, how you recognized which principles would be useful, and the bigger picture the problem is trying to illuminate. If you sense that there are some things you aren't completely grasping, please attend office hours or the MRC (see last two items below) for more conversation.
*   **Office hours.** Students often find that office hours are extremely helpful. You do not have to have any pressing needs to attend office hours: you are welcome to come to chat about the course or go over problems you feel you already mostly understand or whatever. If you feel you have some kind of hangup about coming to office hours, you should come once merely for the sake of clearing that hurdle.
*   **Your fellow students**. Collaboration on solving homework problems is encouraged (though the final write-up must still be your own!), because you can learn a lot from working through problems with one another.
*   **Math Resource Center**. The department [provides learning support](https://www.math.brown.edu/mrc/) for a variety of undergraduate courses at Brown, including Math 0200 (which is close enough to Math 0350). Place & time: Foxboro Auditorium in the math department, 8 PM to 10 PM Monday through Thursday.
*   **Tutoring**. The office of co-curricular advising offers [free group/individual tutoring](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/support/tutor) on a weekly basis, which you sign up for in advance. The department also has a list of graduate students available for private tutoring (though that tends to be expensive).
