# iClicker Cloud

We will be using iClicker Cloud software in this course. I will ask questions regularly throughout class, and you can submit responses using a smartphone or laptop. Your score will be based mostly on participation: 15 points for answering almost all of the questions (you can decline to answer at most one) per class, plus 1 point for each correct answer.

1.  Follow these instructions (edit: the link that was here is now broken). One of the instructions refers to the location of a particular assignment within Canvas. This is in the Assignments tab under iClicker cloud.
2.  That's it!
