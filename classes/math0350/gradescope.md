# Gradescope

In this course students will submit homework using [Gradescope](http://www.gradescope.com). Here are the steps to sign up and submit your homework.

1.  Go to http://www.gradescope.com
2.  Select "Sign up for free"
3.  Select "I am a student"
4.  Use the course entry code MGE5DD, your name (first name **and** last name), your **@brown.edu** email address, and your **Banner** ID (which is on your student ID and looks like B12345678) to sign up
5.  Select "Math 0350"
6.  Select the appropriate homework assignment
7.  Select "Upload PDF" and upload a PDF with your homework in it. It is important that you upload the entire homework packet, which includes space for you to write your answers to each question, as well as some spillover space at the end. If you complete your homework on paper, see [this guide](../pdfs/gradescope_scanning.pdf) for help with scanning using your phone (also, the library has [scanners](http://library.brown.edu/libweb/forug.php)). Alternatively, you can import the PDF in a tablet app (e.g., GoodNotes for iPad), complete the homework in digital handwriting, and export directly to PDF.
8.  Click the "Save" button at the bottom of the page
9.  Please bear in mind that the grader will have to read your work on their computer screen. This means that you need to make sure that your scan is of a reasonable quality. You should position the camera so that the page fills the screen, you should make sure the camera focuses properly, and you should use an actual scanning app (do not use straight-up photos! scanners and scanning apps apply some processing that makes your handwriting much more legible).
